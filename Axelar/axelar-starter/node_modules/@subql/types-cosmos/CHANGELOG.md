### Changed
Sync changes from main SDK:
- Updated `store.getByField` to have limit and offset options: `getByField(entity: string, field: string, value: any, options?: {offset?: number; limit?: number}): Promise<Entity[]>;`.

### Added

## [0.1.0] - 2022-06-27

- Messages and events have changed `message.msg.msg` to `message.msg.decodeMsg.msg`. This is due to lazy loading and will mean you don't need to provide chain types for messages you don't care about (#17)

- Fix chainTypes not being in deployments
